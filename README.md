# auth-backend

Thanks for checking out my project.

**Version:** MVP

This repository demonstrates how to implement an industry-level authentication backend in Node.js, with a focus on security and maintainability.  
Iâ€™m continuously refactoring and improving the code to follow best practices.

**Key features (implemented/planned):**
- JWT authentication
- Refresh token management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management
- Security-focused practices
